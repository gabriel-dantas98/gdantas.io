I started in tech studying computer networks back in high school.\nI graduated in Computer Engineering at FIAP, where I had the chance to work on all kinds of projects: robots, apps, and startup ideas.\n\nSince then I try to keep up-to-date across Dev and Ops. I love to code, but I'm also into the complexity that infrastructure brings. Today I'm an SRE helping dev teams build scalable, observable, resilient services with the right tools :)\n\nI also love starring repos on GitHub hunting for new projects and ideas!",
